# INTERFACE: It is a predefined structure with properties and methods without a 
# determined operation (it acts as a template), this structure or contract is used
# by classes that must implement all the properties and methods established in the
# interface. This is done with the objective of generating an expected behavior in
# different context of use and execution. Additionally, it ensure that a group of 
# programmers follows a specified structure, thus improving the scalability and 
# maintainability of the code.    

# Interfaces can be used within an API (Application Programming Interface), thus 
# providing a defined structure so that different programs and services can 
# communicate with each other in a coherent and predictable way. 

# ABSTRACT METHOD: It is a method of an abstract class or interface that can have 
# the function name, parameters and the type of return value (optional) defined, 
# but does not have an implementation or functionality.
