# INHERITANCE => It allows code reuse through inheritance all public attributes and
# methods from a parent class to a child class, this allows you improving the 
# modularity and scalability of the code.

# PARENT CLASS OR SUPER CLASS => It’s the class from which the other classes inherit.

# CHILD CLASS => It’s the class that inherits attributes and method from the parent 
# class. Also, this should never be equals to the parent class.

# Super() => It’s a function that allows the child class to import attributes or the
# methods code block of a parent class.

# SIMPLE INHERITANCE => It’s the action of inheriting characteristics from a single
# parent class.  

# MULTIPLE INHERITANCES => It’s the action of inheriting characteristics from more 
# than two parent classes. On the other land, same programming languages do not 
# support this feature. It’s recommended to use it with moderation because it 
# increases the complexity of the code, worsening the maintaining and scalability
# of the software.

# SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE => Within it is used child class + “It is always a” + parent
# class, this determine which is the child and parent class between two classes.
