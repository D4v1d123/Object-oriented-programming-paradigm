# COHESION => It means that a module, class, method or function is responsible for
# carrying out a specific task or function within of software. Furthermore, the code
# parts related to a specific function are grouped, forming modules or classes. 

# In programming, we seek to have high cohesion (a modules is used for a specific task
# and not for a general task) guaranteeing better modularization, readability and 
# reducing the maintenance costs.  

# COUPLING => It means that the interconnections between modules, classes, methods or
# functions generate dependencies on each other. 

# In programming, we seek to have low coupling (little interconnections or dependencies
# between modules, classes, method or functions) through modularization, encapsulation
# and application of design patterns such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
# and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), thus allowing to improve the flexibility,
# readability and scalability of the software.
